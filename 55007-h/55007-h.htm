  <h2 id='peter' class='c005'>What Peter Said.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The great Cable celebration at the Crystal
Palace was apparently a cut and dried affair,
for the few speeches transmitted to us by the
press were not only written, but printed in
advance of delivery—a comfortable method of
reporting, very satisfactory, but not quite literal,
as well as undignified in the orator of the
day reading off his speech, schoolboy-like from
the crown of his hat. Peter had his say, and
a very funny say it was, so much so that we
are inclined to believe that Archbishop John,
while “stuffing” at Long Branch, intentionally
quizzed that venerable duck. Peter, when it
came to his say, was chuck full of electricity;
he sparkled and snapped like an aurora borealis;
he was better charged than the cable, and
his eloquence went off with a series of flashes
like the detonations of a Leyden jar. He told
us “his labors which required the indomitable
courage, the far-seeing and electrifying mind
of Cyrus W. Field to inspire and stimulate.”
Cyrus then is the electrical eel of this new
era, and should be carefully preserved within
non-conductors from fear of shocking accidents.
Then Peter got poetical, and travels in the
great garden of the world within and the world
without, and clothes a man there with power.
This great garden could not be that of Eden,
for there nobody went clothed with anything.
And then Peter got surgical, and goes into
midwifery, calling the cable “the umbilical
cord that binds the mother continent to the
child.” Then Peter grew prophetical, and
tells us what electricity will do some day or
the other. And then Peter got enigmatical,
and didn’t know what he did say, and then he
said that language failed him, and upon this
giving out he sat down and looked profound
at everybody and everything for the remainder
of the exercises, bestowing on the audience an
occasional yawn.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='scheme' class='c005'>A New Scheme.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>So the repairs to the City Hall are to be
made by the jobbing system. The contract
system, money-making as it is, is too liable to
be exposed to the inspection and judgment of
the people, but a large job that is split up into
a dozen or more little ones and given out to as
many individuals, pays better, and can be
more secretly conducted; therefore this job
which might be done reasonably low by a
contractor, is to be <em>highly jobbed</em> out piecemeal.
Verily, we live in a great age, have
great city fathers, an illustrious Mayor and
plenty of paint and putty.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='puttyman' class='c005'>Puttyman turned Merriman.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The anecdotes of great man are the treasures
of local history, and are generally presumed
to lend some light upon the trivialities
of State life. Daniel F. Tiemann is reported
to have remarked, in a serious manner it must
be observed, for Daniel is thought to be a teetotaller,
and rarely dons the motley, that
when the Lord Mayor of London hears of our
celebration and burning of the City Hall, he
would return the compliment by setting fire
to the Mansion House. There can be no doubt
that this charitable ebullition of ettiquette will
be accomplished, and were it not for the extreme
modesty of the worshipful Tiemann,
there is little doubt but that his Lordship
would be induced to re-enact the part of Guy
Fawkes, and throw in the two houses of Parliament
by way of a superior pyrotechnical
display. The thanks of the British public are
unquestionably due Puttyman for his moderation,
for were he to will it, the Atlantic Cable
might require the immolation of Gog and Magog,
and, peradventure, the importation of
the Bow Bells. But Puttyman says he was
only joking, and in alluding to the Metropolitan
edifice, intended merely to call forth a sally
of wit instead of a blaze of pure genuine
flame.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first appearance of Mr. Puttyman in his
new character of Merriman, is highly creditable
to a new beginner, and we have little
doubt that after a suitable intellectual training
by Mr. Gossin, and a few stray tricks from
Signor Carlo, he will be able to perform a
creditable engagement with Dan Rice. Indeed,
we do not know but with the aid of lamp-black
and a dictionary, he might be converted
into an excellent Brother Bones, if not a joker
in all the spirit of Tom Brown, and the quaintness
of the late inveterate Horn. When other
occupations are gone. Mr. Puttyman, from this
specimen of jocularity, is entitled to a front
seat in the saw dust.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Eureka.</span>—There having been great inquiry
made as to whom the statue in the City Hall
Park represents, we are happy to inform the
inquisitive that we learn by a dispatch sent us
by the Atlantic Telegraph, that it is the <i>fac
simile</i> of the great Puttyman.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>A Greater Union than the Telegraph.</span>—The
political junction between Peter Cooper
and Tiemann. The cable can’t stand comparison
with the cement of putty and glue.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ray' class='c005'>How to Shed a Ray of Light.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>At the Cable demonstration on the 1st,
Aldermanic politeness showed itself in its true
colors by the virtual expulsion of reporters
from the Crystal Palace. Immediately previously
to the commencement of the exercises,
Mr. Lowber, a protege of the reformer’s, whose
name may be remembered in connection with
a claim against the city, ordered the removal
of the tables and benches allowed to the press.
Alderman Thomas McSpedon, whose name
will become famous to the press before the
whole of the documents in the Hall of Records
are printed, forthwith directed the removal
of the pressgang, which, like the Joseph
Walker, was held by Mr. Lowber to be a
nuisance. This summary proceeding was
characteristic of aldermanic wisdom, by forgetting
that while the wide world was interested
in the cable, our astute gentleman imagined
that he had it safely coiled in his breeches
pocket. Luckily all the addresses, which had
the sanction of the Common Council, were in
print for a few days before their delivery, and
that portion of our municipal greatness has
escaped certain loss. Unfortunately there are
two sides to a question as well as an address,
and as the British recipients of the addresses,
as well as the Captain of the Niagara, were
not up to the mysteries of the Tea-Room,
their replies are forever lost. We have
doubtless lost the wheat and secured the chaff.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Strange, if True.</span>—We read in the <cite>Herald</cite>
the other day, that, in the opinion of that oracle,
the successful laying of the Trans-atlantic
Cable would change the whole moral aspect of
human affairs—the <cite>Herald</cite> included. Now we
must confess we do belong to that class of persons
which believe that physical agency and
morals are intimately allied, and that the great
achievement of submerging the cable will produce
more or less a moral effect. Still we are
doubtful of the <cite>Herald</cite>. We are equally doubtful
whether the successful laying of two cables
and a half dozen other scientific victories much
greater than anything that has yet transpired,
could produce an improvement in the moral
character of the <cite>Herald</cite>. Bennett is too great
and too hardened a sinner. Still we have heard
of repentance at the eleventh hour.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>A Good Idea.</span>—Our devil suggests that the
great Puttyman would do well to hire Jobson
to edit the <cite>Satanic</cite>. This might be beneficial
to Puttyman, but we doubt whether Mr. Jobson
would consent to lend his brain in such a
filthy channel. The great French historian
can do better.</p>

<p class='c006'>Our people have by this time purchased the
significant lesson that it is impossible to create
an elective judiciary, worthy of esteem and
capable of discharging the onerous functions
committed to their custody. The learned Sancho
Panza observed, with respect to the impossibility
of creating silk purses out of sows’
ears. We can do likewise as to the utter inability
of manufacturing judges, worthy of the
ermine, from raw material, such as Mr. Recorder
Barnard and City Judge Russell, neither
of whom would be selected to decide upon
the merits of a cock fight, much less to determine
the rights of personal liberty. Is the
evil to be longer endured, to be incessantly
repeated, or are the people to take the matter
in their own hands that we may divest ourselves
from the burdens which Sinbad-like we
are compelled to bear on our shoulders?</p>

<p class='c007'>We have thoroughly tested the question of
an elective judiciary, both theoretically and
practically, and we have arrived at one conclusion—that
we obtain politicians instead of
judges, and thereby jeopardize the very foundation
of our national liberties. We have
done more, and openly pandered to the lowest
vice in suffering the right of ballot to be prostituted
in order that the most unworthy of
men may creep into the judiciary. We have
emptied the tap-rooms and bar-rooms of their
tenants, and have thus sullied the dignity of
the ermine. We have also done everything
in our power to neutralize the benevolent intentions
of our republican institutions, by corrupting
the only safeguard for their perpetuation.
And this series of calamities is chiefly
attributable to the introduction of the political
manœvre of rendering the judiciary elective,
and thus we have sacrificed the wisdom of
our revolutionary ancestors.</p>

<p class='c007'>A few years ago, when the judiciary were
appointed by the State Senate, and served until
physical infirmities limited the term, the
New York Bench were unrivalled for learning,
courtesy and literary acquirements. Our criminal
judges were particularly distinguished,
and the name of Richard Riker, for many
years Recorder of New York, will be remembered
as that of a worthy and respected magistrate.
Whence have we receded to secure
Russells and Barnards? Nay, we have even
gone to the length of creating offices which
are perfectly useless, and filled them with idle
incumbents. Will any man say that the City
Court exists as a matter of necesity, or that
the duties of the officers do not belong to other
authorities? If not, why not erect a court-room
and not compel its presiding dignitary to
lounge a hanger-on the Court of Sessions. Probably
it is better for the common weal, and
more in accordance with Mr. Russell’s antecedents,
that he be suffered to continue in this
way of life, in which the extent of mischief
may be kept within limit. In the approaching
constitutional convention, the question of an
elective judiciary will be fairly at issue, and it
is one duty that we owe to ourselves to re-organize
the magistracy, that its ancient character
for integrity and truth may be revived
and perpetuated. This work of purification
will probably be strenuously opposed by those
of our politicians, who are dependent to the
gangs of shoulder hitters, and brothel pimps,
now infecting our city and rendering the elective
franchise a political caricature. If we
suffer this opportunity to escape us, we are
unworthy the character of freemen, and deservedly
the cellars of a judiciary, as incompent
as it is useless, and as useless as it is expensive.</p>

  <h2 id='cable' class='c005'>The Tail of the Cable.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>We have had our gay old time; our citizens
have had fireworks, and crackers, and cheese;
our boys have had a turn-out, and our country
cousins have had a most stunning display of
municipal greatness,—in a word, we have glorified
God, the Atlantic Cable, and the Field
family. This is all very well in its way; but
when we come to pay for the piping, we naturally
inquire the reason for all this fuss and
commotion—for the only thing which appears
to be quiet is the cable itself, which neither
works nor gives evidence of any inclination
towards labor. Now that we have had the
fun, let us pay for it.</p>

<p class='c007'>The people of England, who own the Telegraph,
each end being limited to British soil,
and the whole line under control of British
capitalists, seem to have rejoiced over the success
of the great event of the age in a most rational
and sensible manner, while we have apparently
gone mad with joy over an affair
which, in nowise, can be construed into a national
subject. Degrading as it may be to our
personal pride, Peter Cooper, the Field family,
and Archbishop John, to the contrary notwithstanding,
the Atlantic Telegraph is essentially
an English triumph; and in expending a
large sum of money in an ebullition of passing
insanity, our citizens have only rendered themselves
subjects for merriment. Who will deny
that, although the project of an Atlantic Telegraph
was first broached on this side of the
Atlantic, almost the entire credit of its success
has been committed to British hands. The
money was raised in England, and three out
of four vessels, engaged in the enterprize, bore
the British flag. And now have we any just
excuse to run mad with joy, and to add some
fifty thousand additional taxes to our already
over-taxed community?</p>

<p class='c007'>The very character of the procession which
went through our streets was a polite satire
upon the occasion, as it can mainly be regarded
as an illegal method of advertising one’s
wares, which, if persisted in, would prove ruinous
to the Sunday papers. We had cracker
bakers, alcohol dealers, gas stoves, and all that
sort of thing, from the beginning to the end of
the chapter; and one, unacquainted with the
nature of municipal rejoicing, would conceive
the demonstration to have been the American
Institute house-moving on the first of May.
And now that the reign of folly has past, and
the festivity of the occasion wasted into air, a
second, sober thought suggests to us that we
have been manufacturing a very large quantity
of excitement upon a very small capital; and
the more serious this consideration will become
as the moment of payment presses on us. We
have no right to squander public moneys, no
more than that of embezzling from private
persons; still we are well aware that a different
standard of morality governs the actions of
officials from those of the same beings in a
mercantile character. Now that we have
reached the tail of the cable excitement, let us
propound a simple query: What have we
gained by all this frenzy beyond the glorification
of one or two individuals, who have suddenly
discovered themselves to be great? We
have foolishly spent a large sum of money—we
have made an exhibition of ourselves, and
have no equivalent to show in exchange for
our funds and our honor. By the tail of the
cable hangs a curious tale indeed.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Too True by Half.</span>—One of our City Fathers,

improper characters.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='paupers' class='c005'>The Paupers at the Town Table.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>If any man hangs around a public house, dependent
upon the charity of visitors for a drink,
even if it be absolutely necessary to his health,
he is commonly honored with the epithet of a
“bummer;” but when a highly distinguished
politician or other man, too indolent to do his
own work and subsisting from the public till,
hangs around the City Hall, awaiting the
chances at the public table, we fail to recognize
the similarity of his condition with the dry and
athirst of the common tap-room. Now we are
blind enough not to see the distinction between
these two classes of worthies, and we are stupid
enough to enumerate both as under the
same category. It matters little to us whether
the guzzler at the Metropolitan feeds at the
public expense, or Brown at the Pewter Mug
drinks from the involuntary contributions of
Jones or any other private individual. In both
instances the principle is the same, and a man
who dines at the public expense, even if it be
in the name of Cyrus W. Field, is as much of a
sucker as the lounger who insists upon participating
with you in a smile. They are both
paupers, and should be deservedly esteemed as
such by an intelligent community. There is
nothing like calling things by their proper
names, although they may be distasteful to our
so-called Reformers.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is exceedingly strange that any body of
men, pretending to advocate retrenchment in
our finances, will so barefacedly and undisguisedly
seize upon a large sum of money belonging,
as they honorably admit, to a most
over-taxed municipality, and squander it for
the least profitable of animal passions. Three
thousand dollars could be better expended in a
monument or other testimonial of our Cable
joy, than to be guzzled down by a bevy of hungry
hounds, who would have claimed boon-companionship
with Judas Iscariot to get an
invitation to the Last Supper. If it be necessary
to express our joy, why not do it in a rational
manner, like men gifted with reason, and
not guzzle and swill like beasts of the field?
Still the invincible selfishness of our Aldermen
demanded an Aldermanic banquet, whence a
majority of our officials will in all probability
be carried home on a shutter, if they do not
succeed in procuring accommodations at the
public expense in the Fifteenth Ward Station.
Where better to end the bacchanalian revel?
We had believed that, when the iniquity of the
tea-room was suppressed, and the bevy of
loafers who were wont to breakfast, dine and
sup from the free lunch of our Municipal tea-room,
the whole fabrick of guzzling would be
cast down, so that every intelligent and reputable
man would conceive it a species of
larceny to dine at the expense of the poverty-stricken
tax-payers. But that which is bred
in the bone cannot come out from the skin,
and this habit of dining is too deeply seated
to be eradicated from these veterans at the
public table. It would be a curious study for
a statician to compute the amount of groceries,
wet and dry, consumed by some of these well
fed officials, and, when published, would afford
a very instructive lesson in municipal economy.
We will venture to say that Simeon Draper
alone, in the course of his public services, has
deemed it a part of his duty to consume edibles
and drinkables to the extent at least of three
thousand dollars. Here, then, is a question
for disputation at the Institute that, if the
official keep of one man costs such a sum, how
much would it cost to support an army.</p>

<p class='c006'>Notwithstanding the heavy demonstrations
of the Common Council, by word of mouth
and by strength of lung in favor of the Atlantic
Cable, it seems that the reception of the
crew of the Niagara was entirely overlooked
by these distinguished characters, who, in their
ovations to Mr. Cyrus W. Field, and such like
magnates, ignored the existence of such a poor
set of individuals as the absolute toilers, who
live by the sweat of their brow. To make up
for this deficiency in courtesy, a few gentlemen
invited and gave a species of demonstration,
wherein they expected to realize something
digestible for the poor Jacks of our
navy, who, in an humble way at least, contributed
to the success of the great event. Well,
these gentlemen in hiring a room wherein the
speechification could be made, naturally stumbled
upon the great Peter Cooper Institute,
first from the connection Peter had with the
tail end of the cable, and, secondly, from the
fact that they labored under the impression
that the building had been given to our municipality
for the encouragement of arts and
sciences, and, assuredly, what could be more
encouraging to science than a hearty meal after
scientific labor?</p>

<p class='c007'>The committee waited upon the proprietor
of the Institute and discovered the nightly
rent for the use of the hall of the building, so
magnanimously donated to the city, to be
$100. However, the breasts of landlords are
not always of stone, and the illustrious Peter,
taking into consideration the object and
the occasion, kindly consented to receive from
the friends of poor Jack but one-half the
usual price for the loan of a building, vulgarly
conceived to be public property. Now who
dares to assert that Peter, the great and liberal
minded Peter Cooper, never does things by
halves?</p>

<p class='c006'>Cyrus, the great, has been out on a fishing
excursion; he has fished with a long line, a
keen hook, fine bait, and in deep water—caught
a fine kettle of fish and many shiners,
over which the Cooper guild and corporation
feel disposed to make themselves jolly. This
may all be very well, but to us it looks very
much like using an opportunity to make a display
and have a good time generally to glorify
somebody at the expense of the people.</p>

<p class='c007'>With respect to the merits of this cable,
Franklin bottled lightning, Morse discovered
the telegraph principle, Maury the telegraph
plateau, and Cyrus, with the assistance of
Brooks, put the two together, for commercial
purposes, for which Cyrus is to be glorified forever,
while Franklin, Morse and Maury are
forgotten. The whole cost of the cable celebration,
to the city, will not fall much short of
$150,000. Cold winter will soon be here, and
thousands cold and hungry, without the means
to supply themselves with food and fuel; and
we venture to say not $500 could be raised
from the corporation outside the usual appropriations,
to keep them from starvation or
freezing. All this is the result of a nice little
arrangement by the city fathers, who are
mighty fond of guzzling at the public crib
whenever an excuse can be manufactured.
This cable laying furnishes a good one, but the
cable is laid, so let “God be praised,” but not
until Cyrus has had his share.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now that we are going to have a new story
on the City Hall, would it not be an excellent
opportunity to try the highly ingenious scheme
of the venerable Peter Cooper, of converting
the new portion of that public edifice into a
water-tank? What a refreshing idea in the
dog-days!</p>

<p class='c007'>If Peter had only studied political economy
as deeply as he has hydraulics, he might have
improved his scheme of fire-extinguishing and
rendered it at least self-paying, if not a source
of revenue. During the summer months, this
artificial pond could be rendered an excellent
bathing-school, where, beneath the supervision
of some of the unoccupied police, small boys
could be allowed, at a shilling a head, to indulge
in a hydropathic luxury of a dive and
come up again. Beyond this, during the winter,
the pond being subject, we suppose, to the
ordinary afflictions of a cold, might be advantageously
employed for the healthy relaxation
of skating, during which performance the venerable
Peter may patronize the public by an
exhibition of his highly respected person, after
the manner of his great predecessor, Wonter
Von Twiller. By this ingenious arrangement
the great water-tank of the great Peter may
be rendered as great an institution in a sanatory
point of view, as his Institute is to the
intellectual world of our Atlantic Metropolis.
Peter should be a water-cure doctor.</p>

<p class='c006'>Much has been said about the Albany Regency,
whose lawgivers are Thurlow Weed,
Seward &amp; Co., but they cannot compare with
our great Puttyman, Cooper, Draper &amp; Co.
For cunning reforms, soft soap and putty they
have no competitors. While the former has
dined on politicians, the latter has luxuriated
on live alligators—of the short and long branch
species—until they are looking fat and greasy.
We advise Weed and Seward to look well to
their pickets and walls at Syracuse on the 8th
of September, or our great city reformers will
not leave them an atom of power or greatness.
Let Weed remember that these great lights of
Metropolitan glory, have a <em>peculiar</em> way of
doing business, unknown to the scientific of
the present day. The invention is said to be
despotic and arbitrary in its sway over the
masses, but this can hardly be, for our Metropolitans
are clear-sighted people and would
certainly have made the discovery if such was
the case; hence their popularity must originate
from the true greatness of their invention
and the entire approval and encomiums of the
Press during the last three or four weeks. It
is seldom that any new invention confers honor,
fame and fortune upon the inventor, but
this “Branch Incarceration” invention is a
new era in science, law and philosophy. The
inventors are deserving of a monument to perpetuate
their memories to future posterity.
Oh, great Puttyman, little did you think, when
superintending your humble paint manufactory,
that you would ever be connected in such
a great discovery. How great, how powerful
is genius—God-like. Praise God, Puttyman,

<h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>New York.</span> August 23, 1858.</h3>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Sir</span>:—Hitherto I have refrained from addressing
communications to the newspapers
upon <em>any</em> subject of interest to the community,
feeling better satisfied in reading the comments
of persons other than myself. The course of
the prosecution towards the unfortunate Mr.
Branch leads me, for the first time, to speak to
the public through the columns of a public
journal, and suggests to me a number of ideas
which, I think, bear upon the subject. I am
not a personal friend of Mr. Branch, never
having had half a dozen words of conversation
with him. I look upon the prosecution (or,
more properly speaking, the persecution) of
Mr. Branch as a wholesale violation of the
rights and privileges of the citizens of New
York, and a violent outrage upon the spirit
and tenor of our laws. For the first time in
the history of our criminal jurisprudence, we
find a man charged with the commission of an
offence against our laws, arrested, indicted,
tried, convicted, sentenced, and placed in the
vilest servitude, all within the space of two
short weeks. In this extraordinary trial we
see, and painfully too, the establishment of a
precedent to take away our rights and subject
our persons and property to the ruthless grasp
of an interested prosecution. ’Tis true that the
prosecutors in the case of Mr. Branch were
<em>wealthy and in positions of influence, and it
was therefore to be expected that justice should
lean toward them</em>, to the taking away of the
rights of a citizen who could not boast of
<em>wealth</em>. I assert, and without fear of truthful
contradiction, that two-thirds of our community
to-day sympathize with Mr. Branch, and
look upon the course of the prosecution as a
gross violation of their own individual rights,
and such a violation as loudly calls for the indignation
of the people; and it is indeed pleasant
to reflect, that to-day the persecutors of
Mr. Branch are entitled to, and willingly receive,
the supreme contempt and unmitigated
scorn of every lover of justice; and I tell you,
sir, <em>that</em> scorn and contempt will manifest itself
at the ballot-box to such a degree, that <em>certain
persons</em> will wither beneath the loud condemnation
of the honest citizen; and the time will
come when justice shall not be thwarted by
the mere wink of two or three <em>self-interested</em>
individuals, who cannot boast of any <em>particular
merit</em>. I take the position, that whether Mr.
Branch be guilty or <em>not</em> guilty, the trial was
unfair and the sentence unjust; and no evidence
appears to my mind causing me to doubt
but that Mr. Branch’s assertions were correct.
Would it not have been much better, in order
to the proper vindication of the character of
the person against whom the charges were
made by Mr. Branch, that all the circumstances
connected with the affair should have
been brought to light by an even-handed, above-board
trial? Then, if the charges were false,
the prosecution would have established their
honor and integrity in a manner which would
have satisfied the community, and not led them
to look, as they now do, with suspicion. Beyond
all this, Mr. Branch was denied the right
of a preliminary examination; thus showing
that the first step taken by the prosecution
was illegal and unjust. These facts, when
presented to the mind of an enlightened public,
present such formidable proof of the injustice
practised towards Mr. Branch, that it is impossible
to arrive at any other conclusion than
that Mr. Branch has been more sinned against
than sinning. In conclusion I shall say, that,
from what I have discovered of public opinion,
it is high time that something should be done
to rid ourselves of the present administration,
and to put in office men who can be relied
upon; believing as they do that Mr. Branch
has been the victim of political persecution.</p>

<p class='c007'>Let us hope that the time will soon come
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>when the rights of the community will be preserved,

<p class='c006'>No single enterprise better illustrates the
go-ahead-ativeness of Americans than the purchase
by Messrs. Tiffany &amp; Co., the Broadway
jewellers, of the entire surplus of the Atlantic
Telegraph Cable, left on board the Niagara.
They have no possible use for it, beyond the
selling of pieces as specimens to be preserved
as curiosities; and yet, on this speculation
they have advanced some $30,000 or $40,000
hard cash. In some cities, and some countries
they would inevitably find themselves “stuck,”
as the newsboys say; but here, they will, assuredly
and deservedly, reap a rich reward.
They are selling the pieces, plain and mounted
with <i>fac simile</i> certificates by Mr. Field, at all
prices, from 50 cents upwards, about as fast as
they can cut them off.—<cite>Sun.</cite></p>

<p class='c007'>Now, of what real utility is a piece of this
supposed cable? None whatever. We strongly
suspect hundreds of mechanics are employed
daily in manufacturing a <i>fac simile</i> of the
Atlantic Cable, and doubtless will continue to
be so employed as long as a purchaser for a
piece of “that Cable” can be found. For
gullibility, New Yorkers are certainly the
<em>greenest</em> of the human species. Still, perhaps,
an imitation of “that Cable” will answer every
purpose, and enrich the retailer at the expense
of the credulous. We intend to get a

<p class='c023'>AN ACT to submit the question of calling a Convention to revise
the Constitution and amend the same, to the People of the
State:</p>

<p class='c021'>Passed April 17, 1858—three-fifths being present.</p>

<p class='c023'><i>The People of the State of New York, represented in Senate
and Assembly, do enact as follows</i>:</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Section 1.</span> The Inspectors of Election in each town, ward, and
election district in this State, at the annual election to be held in
November next, shall provide a proper box to receive the ballots
of the citizens of this State entitled to vote for members of the
Legislature at such election. On such ballot shall be written or
printed, or partly written and printed, by those voters who are in
favor of a Convention, the words: “Shall there be a Convention
to Revise the Constitution and amend the same? Yes.” And by
those voters who are opposed thereto, the words: “Shall there be
a Convention to Revise the Constitution and amend the same?
No.” And all citizens entitled to vote as aforesaid shall be allowed
to vote by ballot as aforesaid, in the election district in which
he resides, and not elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c021'>§2. So much of the articles one, two and three, of title four, of
chapter one hundred and thirty, of an act entitled “An act respecting
elections other than for militia and town officer,” passed
April fifth, eighteen hundred and forty-two, and the acts amending
the same, as regulates the manner of conducting elections and
challenges, oaths to be administered, and inquiries to be made, of
persons offering to vote, shall be deemed applicable to the votes to
e given or offered under the act; and the manner of voting and
challenges, and the penalties for false swearing, prescribed by law,
are hereby declared in full force and effect in voting or offering to
vote under this act.</p>

<p class='c021'>§3. The said votes given for and against a convention, in pursuance
of this act, shall be canvassed by the Inspectors of the several
election districts or polls of the said election in the manner prescribed
by law, and as provided in article four, of title four, of
chapter one hundred and thirty of the said act, passed April fifth,
eighteen hundred and forty-two, and the acts amending the same,
as far as the same are applicable; and such canvass shall be completed
by ascertaining the whole number of votes given in each
election district or poll for a convention, and the whole number of
votes given against such convention, in the form aforesaid; and
the result being found, the inspectors shall make a statement in
words, at full length, of the number of ballots received in relation
to such convention, and shall also state in words, at full length,
the whole number of ballots having thereon the words, “Shall
there be a Convention to revise the Constitution and amend the
same? No.” Such statements as aforesaid shall contain a caption,
stating the day on which, and the number of the district, the
town or ward, and the county at which the election was held, and
at the end thereof a certificate that such statement is correct in all
respects, which certificate shall be subscribed by all the inspectors,
and a true copy of such statement shall be immediately filed by
them in the office of the clerk of the town or city.</p>

<p class='c021'>§4. The original statements, duly certified as aforesaid, shall be
delivered by the inspectors, or one of them to be deputed for that
purpose, to the supervisor, or, in case there be no supervisor, or
he shall be disabled from attending the board of canvassers, then
to one of the assessors of the town or ward, within twenty-four
hours after the same shall have been subscribed by such inspectors,
to be disposed of as other statements at such election, are
now required by law.</p>

<p class='c021'>§5. So much of articles first, second, third, and fourth, of title
fifth, of chapter one hundred and thirty, of the act entitled, “An
act respecting elections other than for militia and town officers,”
and the acts amending the same, as regulates the duties of County
Canvassers and their proceedings, and the duty of County
Clerks, and the Secretary or State, and the Board of State Canvassers,
shall be applied to the canvassing and ascertaining the
will of the people of this State in relation to the proposed convention;
and if it shall appear that a majority of the votes or
ballots given in and returned as aforesaid are against a convention,
then the said canvassers are required to certify and declare
that fact by a certificate, subscribed by them, and filed with the
Secretary of State; but if it shall appear by the said canvass that
a majority of the ballots or votes given as aforesaid are for a convention,
then they shall by like certificates, to be filed as aforesaid,
declare that fact; and the said Secretary shall communicate
a copy of such certificate to both branches of the Legislature,
at the opening of the next session thereof. Yours, respectfully,</p>

  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
